sentence=Easy-to-use Arduino datalogger for DS3231 RTC and SD card logging.
paragraph=Ardulogger is a lightweight Arduino library for autonomous, timestamped datalogging. It uses the DS3231 real-time clock and an SPI-based SD card module to log sensor readings in CSV format. The library is designed to be as simple as possible to use—bind variables with a label once, then log them continuously with a single call. Automatically handles timestamping, headers, precision, and comment logging. Ideal for greenhouse monitoring, scientific experiments, or remote sensing projects.
