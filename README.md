# Agduino
A compact root module system to use with an Arduino Nano, Screw Terminal, RTC 3231, and SD Card module for simple datalogging.

Primarily for use with thr Arduino Nano Family. 
The Logger library provides easy device fusion for datalogging using the RTC and SD libraries. While this library can be used for any Arduino IDE cabale board, it was designed to be used with the Arduino Nano family.
